1 well in data structure if we see serching,then first thing comes into our mind is linear search

it is the most simple searching algo, here it involves checking all the elements of array 1 by 1 till the desired is not found

so the best case complexity is 1, as we can find the desired element in 1st comparison
and the average case complexity is (n+1)/2
but the worst case complexity  is o(n), because we need to search all the elements in array

so its usage depends upon total no of elements in array,it it less we will use else not
here you dont need to sort array

like there are 4 elements in array
if it is found at first then 1 comparison
so total cases would be 1+2+3+4 .....   (1+n)/2

The second solution comes to this problem is binary search, binary search works on the sorted array

here first we find the middle element of array,
