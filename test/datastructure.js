Datastructures are thr progmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently

efficiency of your algo mainly based on twoo factors time complexity and space complexity


//asymptottic notations

//Usually time required by an algo falls under 3 category
best case, average case and worst case

BIgoh-- worst case complexity
omega-- best case complexity
theta-- shows both



1:Greedy APproach

suppose i have to count 18 using coins of 10,5,2,1
greedy says first choose the biggest value then move to the smaller one
here 1st i choose 10 then 5 then 2,then 2

suppose i have to count 14 and i have 10,7,1 no. coins

then i will take 10,1,1,1,1 according to greedy but it should be 7,7,1 which contains only three coins

2: DEvide and conquer: here we divide the problems into smaller sub parts and then solve each problem and combine their results

3: Dynamic Programming : Same as Devide and conquerbut unlike this subproblems are not solved independently.. they are divided into similar problems & result is reused
